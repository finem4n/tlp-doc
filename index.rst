    TLP is a feature-rich command line utility for Linux, **saving laptop
    battery power**  without the need to delve deeper into technical details.

    TLP's default settings are already **optimized for battery life** and
    implement Powertop's recommendations out of the box, so you can install
    it and just **sit back and relax**!

    But wait, there's more! TLP is **completely customizable**, which means
    you can **get even more power savings** or meet your exact requirements â€“
    the possibilities are endless.
